## Description
SquadFi is inspired by the need of decentralization in the validation ecosystem of the Ethereum Network. Our browser-based frontend allows users to create a squad (validator cluster) or join one. Validator Squads aim to enhance the decentralization, security, and fault tolerance of Ethereum network while optimizing the processes involved.

SquadFi is designed to operate by distributing the validation process across a squad (cluster) of up to 4 nodes (initially). Each node acts as a validator, contributing to the consensus mechanism. This decentralization helps to prevent a single point of failure, enhances the overall security of the network, increases yield, while decreasing minimum required deposit. Even if ‚Öì of the validators experience downtime, the squad (cluster) performs.

Enhanced security comes from ensuring that no single node possesses complete authority over the private key at any moment, minimizing the risk of a compromise.

## Sponsors Tech Used

### Wallet Connect

We have integrated Web3 Inbox SDK which enables squads to track their nodes status as well as embrace the chat functionality to coordinate.

### Safe

Our app integrates a Multisig "Safe" Wallet for seamless funding coordination and consensus among squad members, eliminating the need for complex configurations. Smart contracts enable trustless deposits and flexible opt-out options.

### ENS Domains

We have integrated ‚ÄúENS Domains‚Äù using a proxy contract to deploy different withdrawal recipients for each squad. We are utilizing ENS Subdomains, so that each withdrawal recipient can have their own subdomain, and therefore are easily findable by the squad mates.

### MEV Blocker

We are prompting cats to utilize the power of MEV Blocker to prevent frontrunning and sandwich attacks via a hyperlinked button on our fronend as well as notification prompting visitors to get protected now!
